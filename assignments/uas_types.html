<h2>Types of UAS</h2>

During the first lecture you’ve learned about different types of UAS
and different applications. Since it is impossible to get to know the
whole rapidly growing market of UAS, your task will be to pick one of
them (listed during the lecture or something completely different) and
prepare a short description (presentation) that you will present to
your colleagues. This way at the end of class we will be familiar with
several types and applications of UAS.

<p>
Presentation should be not more than 3-4 min long (just couple slides!) and include following info:

<ul>
    <li>Name of the UAS
    <li>Picture
    <li>Type 
    <li>Place (country) and year of manufacture
    <li>Technical specifications (size, weight, endurance, wingspan, payload….)
    <li>Main applications 
    <li>Then pick a case study that will show how the chosen UAS
        was used in industry/research/combat/private needs and
        what kind of outputs/results were obtained?
</ul>

<p>
Try to find something relevant for your research interest or just something unique that will be worth sharing.

<p>
You will present your work in the class on Sep 3rd
