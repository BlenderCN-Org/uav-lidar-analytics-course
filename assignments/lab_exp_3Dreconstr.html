<h2>Laboratory experiment: 3D reconstruction from multiple photos</h2>

Perform laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of the number and orientation
of photos, shape and features of a landscape model and light on 3D reconstruction
of a physical landscape model from multiple overlapping imagery.

<p>
We have several 3D physical models in the geoviz lab, select one and create
its 3D digital model using your camera and appropriate software.

<p>
Take the photos from various locations and place features on the physical model
to explore the best approach for obtaining a model with minimal distortions.
Use any suitable software for example:
