<h2>Flight plan preparation</h2>


Considering the technical, meteorological and legal conditions of the
possible flight area choice, you shouldn’t forget about the most
important element: the aim and purpose of the flight.

<p>
In this assigment you need to justify the choice of the flight area and
prove that the geographical aln legal conditions allow for a save
flight execution. You will present your idea to the collegues, so try
to find an interesting research problem. The presentation needs to be
short (2-3min, just couple slides) and doesn’t need to include all the
information from the assignment. Maps and photos highly

<p>
If you need you can attach to the assignment a photo, figure or map.

<li>Motivation

    <ul>
        <li>Why do you want to fly over this area? (state the research problem)
            <ul>
                <li>what problem are you aiming to solve,
                <li>what research question to answer,
                <li>or what object or phenomenon to investigate
            </ul>
    </ul>

<li>Possibility of executing flight over desired area

    <ul>
        <li>Chosen take off location
            (short description helping with localization of the spot)
        <li>Chosen landing location
            (short description helping with localization of the spot)
        <li>Alternate landing location
            (short description helping with localization of the spot)
        <li>Coordinates of the take-off and landing locations
        <li>Property of the ground (public, private - is there permission from the landowner?)
        <li>Accessibility of the take-off location
            (brief description of possible obstacles or difficulties to get to the area or set the launcher)
        <li>Formal possibilities of flight execution
            (does this area have COA, who obtained it, what is the status of the area according to the <a href="https://skyvector.com/">aeronautical charts</a>
    </ul>

<li>Relief conditions and possibilities of safe flight execution

    <ul>
        <li>Targeted area (ha or sq. km)
        <li>Area radius (distance between the ground
            station location and the furthest spot to be mapped
        <li>Elevation differences between the Digital Surface Model and the flight ceiling (in GIS)
        <li>Brief description of geographical conditions (topography, land use, terrain obstacles, ground activity etc.)
    </ul>

<li>Flight parameters

    <ul>
        <li>Desired resolution (for orthophoto or DSM)
        <li>Desired overlap
    </ul>

<li>Attachments

    <ol>
        <li>Map of the flight area with following elements indicated
            <ul>
                <li>Take off and landing locations
                <li>Safe, obstacle free take off and landing
                <li>Borders of the desired mapping area
                <li>Ground station radius
            </ul>
        <li>Flight plan file (.gwt files)
        <li>Presentation
