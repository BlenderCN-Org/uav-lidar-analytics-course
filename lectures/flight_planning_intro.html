    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand</strong> the importance of flight planning for safe mission execution</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize</strong> the relationship between flight parameters and acquired data quality</li>
        <li><strong>Choose</strong> appropriate mission area and flight parameters for answering previously stated research question</li>
        <li><strong>Outline</strong> the workflow for flight planning - in the lab and in the field</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze</strong> flight path taking into account terrain obstacles, UAS technical limitations and legal issues</li>     
        <li><strong>Prepare</strong> ready-to-use flight plan for executing the mission</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Where yould you like to fly?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">In this assigment you need to justify the choice of the flight area and prove that the geographical and legal conditions allowing for a save flight execution.
<h3>Why do you want to fly there?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Considering the technical, meteorological and legal conditions of the possible flight area choice, you shouldn’t forget about the most important element: the aim and purpose of the flight. 
</section>

<section>
<h3>Show us your flight idea!</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">You will present your idea to the collegues, so try to find an interesting research problem.
	<ul>
        <li> The presentation needs to be short (2-3min) and doesn’t need to include all the information from the assignment.</li>
	</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Written version of the assignment is based on two tasks: <a href="https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/trimble_workflow.html">Flight planning in Trimble Aerial Imaging</a> and <a href="https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/flight_prep_GIS.html">GIS analysis of flight plan using lidar-based DSM</a>

<h3> 1. Motivation</h3> 
<p><strong> State the research problem</strong> 
	<ul> Why do you want to fly over this area? 
		<ul>
	 	       <li>what problem are you aiming to solve,</li>
	 	       <li>what research question to answer, </li>
	 	       <li>or what object or phenomenon to investigate.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3> 2. Relief conditions and legal issues</h3> 
	<ul> 
<li>Brief description of geographical conditions (topography, land use, terrain obstacles, ground activity etc.)
<li>Property of the ground (public, private - is there permission from the landowner?) 
<li>Formal possibilities of flight execution (does this area have COA, who obtained it, what is the status of the area according to the <a href="https://skyvector.com/">aeronautical charts</a>
</section>
<section>
<h3>3. Flight parameters adn specifications </h3>
		<ul>
	 	       <li>Targeted area (ha or sq. km) </li>
	 	       <li>Area radius (distance between the ground station location and the furthest spot to be mapped </li>
	 	       <li>Chosen take off, landing and alternate landing location (short description helping with localization of the spots) </li>
			<li>Accessibility of the take-off location (brief description of possible obstacles or difficulties to get to the area or set the launcher)</li>
			<li>Elevation differences between the Digital Surface Model and the flight ceiling (in GIS)</li>
			<li>Edesired resolution and chosen overlap</li>	
	</ul>
