<h2>Flight plan preparation</h2>


Considering the technical, meteorological and legal conditions of the
possible flight area choice, you shouldn’t forget about the most
important element: the aim and purpose of the flight.

<p>
In this assigment you need to justify the choice of the flight area and
prove that the geographical aln legal conditions allow for a save
flight execution. You will present your idea to the collegues, so try
to find an interesting research problem. The presentation needs to be
short (2-3min, just couple slides) and doesn’t need to include all the
information from the assignment. Maps and photos highly

<p>
If you need you can attach to the assignment a photo, figure or map.

<li>Motivation

    <ul>
        <li>Why do you want to fly over this area? (state the research problem)
            <ul>

                <li>what research question to answer,
                <li>or what object or phenomenon to investigate)
