<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<h3>Course description</h3>
The course explains digital representation and analysis of geospatial
phenomena and provides foundations in methods and algorithms used in
GIS analysis. Special focus is on terrain modeling,
geomorphometry, watershed analysis and introductory  GIS-based
 modeling of landscape processes (water, sediment).
The course includes analysis from lidar data, coastal change assessment and 3D visualization.

please always make an appointment by email (Monday afternoon is usually also available): hmitaso@ncsu.edu



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Knowledge of GIS principles at introductory level or strong computational background,
GIS410 Introduction to GIS, GIS510 Introduction to GIScience or
GIS530 Principles of GIScience are recommended</p>

<h3>Educational Approach:</h3>
This course will consist of: lectures, readings,
hand-on exercises, homework assignments, and a major
project. All the work will be collected within an electronic
portfolio that will systematically include the work that you will do
