   <h3>UAS for monitoring changes</h3>
Low cost and rapid deployment: excellent for monitoring changes at local scale (fields, small watersheds)
<p>
<ul>
   <li class="fragment">crop monitoring: growth, disease, stress</li>
   <li class="fragment">erosion processes: coastal, stream bank, rills and gullies</li>
   <li class="fragment">natural disasters: flooding, landslides, fire </li>
   <li class="fragment">mining, construction sites </li>
</ul>
<!--<p><img  height="250" class="fragment" src="img/lidar/midpines_lidar_plasviewcozoom.jpg"></p>-->
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Monitoring design</h3>
<p>Assess:
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">metrics to quantify changes: relative height, volume, feature migration</li>
    <li class="fragment">spatial resolution needed to capture the changes</li>
    <li class="fragment">temporal resolution: regular intervals, events </li>
    <li class="fragment">accessibility: flying over people, line of sight, suitable GCPs </li>
    <li class="fragment">georeferencing, rectification: GCPs distribution and survey</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Processing time series</h3>
<ul>
<li>analyze and interpolate point clouds: DSMs with aligned, common resolution grids
<li>raster DSMs are more suitable for time series than TIN
<li>use GCPs and permanent features to evaluate accuracy, correct errors and distortions
<li>assign time stamps and register raster DSMs within GIS-based temporal data framework
</ul>
<p>Our time series of DSMs in Sketchfab
</section>

<section>
 <h3>Temporal data framework</h3>
<ul>
 <li>supports efficient processing, management and analysis of space-time data sets
 <li>space-time dataset is a set of maps registered in a temporal database
 <li>space-time dataset may represent a dynamic process, 
 <li>individual maps represent the states at a given time
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Time stamp type</h3>
<ul>
 <li>time stamp: assigns time to an individual map in space-time daya set
 <li>time instant: snapshot at given time: 2013-10-15 13:00:00 (absolute time)
 <li>time interval: defined by start and end time: day, month, year (relative time)
 <li>a single UAS survey represents a snapshot (state) which can be agreggated into intervals
</ul>
<p>our time snapshot (sept surveys) and aggregated map

  <h3>Registered time series</h3>
Timeline tool: time and spatial extent of registered maps

   <h3>Temporal plot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plot time series of elevation values at a given location
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Temporal count and intersection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Count: number of maps (temporal snapshots) where the given cell has non-null value (overlap)
<li>Intersection: grid cells with non-null values from each map in time series
</ul>

   <h3>Temporal aggregation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temporally aggregate maps over given period of time - for example to derive monthly average elevation
</ul>

   <h3>Basic time series analysis</h3>
<p>
Per cell statistics (focal) computed for each cell over the time series:
<ul>
 <li>mean and standard deviation
 <li>min, max elevation and range 
 <li>time at minimum, time at maximum
 <li>linear regression: slopem offset, regr. coefficient
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Basic time series analysis: core, envelope</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Core surface: min. elevation measured for each cell  
 <li>Envelope: max. elevation measured for each cell 
</ul>
<p> Example: cutting plane with lidar, core and envelope
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Detecting surveys with large distortions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Derive bare ground from UAS time series using core
<li>Compute difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface: identify DSMs with large distortions
<li>Compute time of minimum raster to identify the distorted DSMs with elevation well below lidar bare ground
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Corrected UAS core surface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove distorted DSMs from derivation of core surface
<li>Difference between UAS core and lidar bare ground surface is very small
<li>Hist. equalized color ramp for differences highlights the shift in lidar swath
</ul>

   <h3>Basic time series analysis: core, envelope</h3>
<p>Envelope: what is the max height of crop in each pixel over the monitored period?
<p>time of maximum - when was the crop highest at each grid cell?
<p>where is the largest range and variability in crop height?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Basic time series analysis: core, envelope</h3>
<p>use envelope to show all cars ever parked there
<p>core, snapshot, envelope, use e.g. to manage parking area
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Basic time series analysis: regression</h3>
<p>longer time series, select subset where the changes are close to linear - e.g. certain crop growth,
<p>per cell linear regression analysis: map of regression slope and offset
