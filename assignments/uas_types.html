<h2>UAS: systems and applications</h2>

During the first lecture you’ve learned about different types of UAS
and a broad range of their applications. Since it is practically impossible 
to be familiar with all of the existing and emerging UAS your task is to select one system and
prepare a short presentation for the class. If you have previous experience
with UAS your presentation can describe your project. This way we will be able 
to learn about a broad range of UAS and their applications.

<p>
The presentation should be 15 minutes long and include the following:

<ul>
    <li>Name of the UAS
    <li>Photo and/or diagram of its components
    <li>Type 
    <li>Place (country) and year of manufacture
    <li>Technical specifications (size, weight, endurance, wingspan, payload….)
    <li>Main applications 
    <li>Case study that shows how this UAS
        was used in industry/research/combat/private needs and
        what kind of outputs/results were obtained
</ul>

<p>
Try to find something relevant to your research interest or just something unique that will be worth sharing.
