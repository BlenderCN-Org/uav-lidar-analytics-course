<h2>Analysis of UAS data processing results</h2>

<h4>Outline:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Compare survey data and errors from different flights</li>
    <li>Recognize differences in geoprocessing products generated by different softwares</li>
    <li>Understand significance of using GCPs in the processing and their impact on the final products
    <li>Recognize what processing steps need to be modified in order to improve particular errors
    <li>Understand what causes the 'Bowl effect' and know the solutions to fix it
    <li>Execute distance, area and volume measurements</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assignment </h4>
<ul>

<li><a href="../assignments/volumes.html">Execute measurements in Agisoft Photoscan</a> 

<li><a href="../assignments/analysis.html">Analyze differences in DSMs </a> 
generated using different techniques or acquired at different times. Distiguish
between errors, artifacts and real change in vegetation and/or bare ground surface.
</ul>

<h4>Homework:</h4>
Prepare report on the results of measurements in Agisoft and DSM comparison in GRASS GIS
Include figures/graphs and calculations.
