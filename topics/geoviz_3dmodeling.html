<h2>Geovisualization of 3D/4D analytics</h2>

<h4>Outline:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Importing Wavefront 3D mesh (.obj)
    <li>Processing UAV meshes: Decimation, Mesh refinement, and Texture refinement </li>
    <li>Shading the UAV mesh: Draping geospatial simulations, Orthophoto and blended textures.
    <li>Importing digital surface models 
    <li>Animation and path tracking
    <li>Web export   
</ul>

<h4>Assignment </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Follow the tutorial steps and report your results
  <li> Reflect on the following points:
      <ul>
    <li> How do you think 3D modeling, rendering, animation and Web3D can benefit your future UAV projects ?
    <li> Think out of the Box! Describe one innovative visulization or interaction method that you imagine developing using combination of Blender and other software 
        you learned about throughout the semester ? eg. An interactive online 3D tool wherein users can dynamicaly toggle between several analysis 
        maps (NDVI,Erosion,Waterflow,etc.) draped onto the UAV derived 3D model. 
       </ul>
</ul>
