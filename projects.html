<h4>Presentation and paper requirements</h4>
<p>
Presentation:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Length: 15 min + 5 min discussion
 <li>Introduction/background: problem, motivation for the research, research question / objective
 <li>Study site: where, why this site, geographic characteristics
 <li>Data acquisition: platform and sensor, flight plan (if applicable), flight conditions 
 <li>Data properties and processing: resolution, spatial extent, accuracy
 <li>Analysis and/or modeling methods: describe methodology and workflows 
 <li>Results: present and explain the results
     using qualitative and quantitative description, tables, graphs, maps/images,
 <li>Discussion: discuss impact of flight conditions, data and methods on the results, 
     uncertainty issues, compare with results from other studies,
     which questions remain unresolved, what still needs to be done
 <li>Conclusion: summary of the most important findings including advances in methodology, future work
</ul>

Paper
<ul>
 <li>Structure and formatting should follow scientific journal standards.
 <li>Same sections as the presentation
 <li>Text and Figures: min. 4 pages, single spaced including tables and references
images, maps, graphs, presented in readable size with scale and legends where needed
 <li>References: at least 5 papers from scientific journals, rest can be reports, web documents
 <li>Appendix (optional): workflows, scripts, metadata. Software commands, issues go here
</ul>
