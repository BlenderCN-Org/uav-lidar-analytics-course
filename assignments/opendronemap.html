<h2>Processing of UAS imagery in OpenDroneMap</h2>

We will reconstruct DSM and create orthophoto in <a href="http://opendronemap.github.io/odm/">
OpenDroneMap</a> - open source toolkit for processing civilian drone imagery.

<h3>Setting up Docker and directory structure</h3>

We will run OpenDroneMap using Docker to simplify setup on different
operating systems (the internally used operating system is Ubuntu).
OpenDroneMap doesn't have a desktop GUI, we will run it in command line,
which is quite simple once we deal with preprocessing and dependencies.

<ol>

<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
    for your platform if you don't have it already. See
    <a href="https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/open-science-course/topics/environments.html">an open science class instructions</a>
    for introduction to Docker and recommended download links.
</li>

<li>We need a command line to run Docker. If you are using Windows,
    download <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">Git for Windows</a>
    unless you are already using some other shell (command line,
    terminal).
</li>

<li>Either in file manager or in command line create a directory
    called <code>odm</code>. Put it somewhere with enough disk space.
    Inside the <code>odm</code> directory create directories
    <code>images</code>, <code>orthophoto</code>,
    <code>georeferencing</code>, and <code>texturing</code>.
    On unix-like systems, creating the directories would look something
    like this:
<pre><code>
mkdir odm
cd odm
mkdir images
mkdir orthophoto
mkdir georeferencing
mkdir texturing
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>Get your data ready:
    Download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXfnlzUkpqcGl3V2ZMeTQ2VmJUeTFkNXJ6al83UGJJR2VXaVRRUWRIVWpHZDg">photos and log</a>
    for the class. Unzip them. Move the images and all the other files
    to the <code>images</code> directory (no subdirectories).
    On unix-like systems, moving of the files would look something like
    this:
<pre><code>
mv unzipped-dir/* images/
</code></pre>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Preprocesing of images</h3>

OpenDroneMap takes GPS position and focal length from images, not from the log.
Since the images don't have this information in their EXIF data, we will have
to add them there. First, we will need to convert the <code>.jxl</code> log
file into a CSV file using
<a href="https://github.com/wenzeslaus/jxl2csv">Vashek's script jxl2csv</a>.
Then we need to upload the focal length and GPS into the photos' EXIF data,
because our photos don't have this information in EXIF.
We will use
<a href="https://github.com/petrasovaa/write-EXIF-GPS">Anna's script</a>
for that. Finally, we will need to identify GCPs in the images.

<p>
On a Linux machine, it would be straightforward to install the missing
dependencies and execute the given commands, but it is hard to have
general instructions how to do it on all operating systems.
Therefore, we will use Docker to get the unified Linux environment.
Since we will need to use the OpenDroneMap image later, we will
use it right now as well just the get the Linux environment.
All the commands in this section will have the following schema:

<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w /code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "ls"
</code></pre>

where <code>-v</code> links our directory <code>images</code> to
a directory inside Docker container, <code>--entrypoint</code> replaces
the executable specified by the OpenDroneMap image by <code>bash</code>
which we will use to execute commands indiside the Docker container,
<code>-w</code> specifies the current working directory inside the
container, and finally <code>-c "ls"</code> at the end of the command
specifies the actual command we want to prefecture inside the container,
for example <code>ls</code> in this example.

<p>
The string <code>$(pwd)</code> in the commands stands for the current
working directory which should be the <code>odm</code> directory
we created earlier.
On MS Windows, you many need to change <code>$(pwd)</code> to
<code>%cd%</code> in all the following commands.
Alternatively, you can manually replace <code>$(pwd)</code> by the full
path.

<p>
Get the script, convert to CSV, and lowercase all image names in the CSV
file to match the photos' names which are lowercase:
<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w/code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wenzeslaus/jxl2csv/master/jxl2csv.py > jxl2csv.py"
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w/code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "python jxl2csv.py full.jxl full.csv"
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w/code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "tr A-Z a-z &lt; full.csv &gt; full_lowercase.csv"
</code></pre>

Update EXIF with GPS coordinates, focal length, camera model. There will
be some warnings and errors about missing files and truncating the
entry, ignore them.
<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w /code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrasovaa/write-EXIF-GPS/master/write_exif_GPS.py > write_exif_GPS.py"
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w /code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "apt update &amp;&amp; apt install proj-bin exiv2 &amp;&amp; python write_exif_GPS.py full_lowercase.csv"
</code></pre>
Warning: script <code>write_exif_GPS.py</code> is not general, focal length and camera model are hardcoded
and must be changed for different cameras.
<p>
To georeference the DSM, we need to prepare a text file with each GCP on one line,
where the numbers represent GCP X, GCP Y, GCP altitude, image column, image row, image name.
For example:
<pre><code>
636795.964 219156.17 105.06 1588 2066 DSC01861.jpg
</code></pre>
Download the <a href="./resources/gcp_odm.txt">prepared GCP file here</a>.
This file was manually prepared by identifying the GCPs on selected
images.
<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images --entrypoint "bash" -w /code/images opendronemap/opendronemap -c "curl http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/uav-lidar-analytics-course/assignments/resources/gcp_odm.txt > gcp_odm.txt"
</code></pre>

Now we are ready to run OpenDroneMap!

<h3>Running OpenDroneMap</h3>

Run ODM through Docker. We will use default parameters.
To review parameters run:

<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm opendronemap/opendronemap --help
</code></pre>

Now we launch the computation. We will keep default values, but we need to specify the path to file with GCPs.
<pre><code>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/images:/code/images -v $(pwd)/orthophoto:/code/odm_orthophoto -v $(pwd)/georeferencing:/code/odm_georeferencing -v $(pwd)/texturing:/code/odm_texturing opendronemap/opendronemap --mesh-size 100000 --gcp /code/images/gcp_odm.txt
</code></pre>

OpenDroneMap will do the processing in parallel. However, each process
requires certain amount of memory (RAM) based on the size of input
images. If you want to limit the memory usage, you need to limit the
number of processes using the <code>--opensfm-processes</code> command
line option.

<h3>Running WebODM</h3>

Install additional packages for management of WebODM (assuming you
already have Docker up and running):

<pre><code>
sudo apt install docker-compose python-setuptools python-pip
</code></pre>

Get WebODM code using Git:

<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM --config core.autocrlf=input
</code></pre>

Go the the course code directory:

<pre><code>
cd WebODM
</code></pre>

Start WebODM:

<pre><code>
./webodm.sh start &amp;
</code></pre>

Now go to the URL specified in the output, it will be likely
<tt>http://localhost:8000</tt>. You will be prompted to create an
administrator account. Create it. It will be the only account we will
need for the exercise.

Upload images to the task which is already there or create a new one.
Change the resolution of images to 800 to speed up the upload and
computation (this reduces the quality of the images).

Now you need to wait for the processing to finish. To follow the
processing, you can access WebODM from outside the VCL machine. Enter
the VCL machine IP address as URL to your web browser and add
<tt>:8000</tt> to it. You should get a login page and you should be able
to log in using the admin account credentials you created earlier.

<h3>Using the results</h3>

All results are stored in the <code>odm</code> directory,
specifically in <code>orthophoto</code> and <code>georeferencing</code>
subdirectories.
We are interested in the point cloud located in the
<code>georeferencing</code> directory.
The point cloud is available as a LAS or text file.
In GRASS GIS, you can use
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.in.lidar.html">r.in.lidar</a>
module or
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.in.xyz.html">r.in.xyz</a>
module to create a DSM by binning
or <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a>
to interpolate a DSM.
The georeferenced orthophoto is a <code>.tif</code> file located in the
<code>orthophoto</code> directory.
The CRS of the point cloud and orthophoto should be in EPSG:3358
(NC State Plane Meters).

To view and edit the mesh stored as OBJ and located in the
<code>texturing</code> directory, we can use MeshLab.
MeshLab can also import the point cloud stored as PLY file.
