<h2>GIS based analysis of UAS derived data processing outputs</h2>

<p>This assignment requires critical thinking about the processing outputs. <br>In the scope of your project (previously stated research problem) run the necessary analysis in GIS software. 
<ul>
<li>You can use the timeseries of data from the GRASS location if your project includes changes in terrain in time. 
<li>There are also orthophotomaps and point clouds available from all the flights (dates in DSM file names). If you need any of them – please request the specific file and format. Note that especially orthophotos are quite large files – up to couple GB.
</ul>
<br>
If you want to use data from your research – I strongly encourage you to do so and share the results with others!
<br>
<br>
<strong> In the report include:</strong> 
<ul>
	<li>Your research problem/research question
	<li>Steps and procedures the you performed in order to answer this question
	<li>Obstacles and problems you’ve encountered
</ul>
Asses the relevance of UAV derived data and processing outputs for solving your research problem. <br><br>
<strong>You will present your results in front of the class. </strong> <br></p> <br><br>
Some additional issues worth investigating:
<ul>
	<li>Including GCPs in geoprocessing improves the results. Does it have an effect on phenomenon that you are investigating?
	<li>Agisoft is only one of the software solutions available for the UAV data processing. In the GRASS location there are available DSM generated in different environments: opendronemap, Pix4D and Trimble Business Center (just for one example flight). If it is relevant to your research scope, you can include comparison of this results.
	<li>n assignment 3 you’ve used arbitrary given parameter values in each processing step. You can change various modes, quality, values and options and investigate if it does improve the results for investigation of your chosen phenomenon. You can find descriptions of the options for each processing step on lecture slides and in the Agisoft Manual
</ul>
