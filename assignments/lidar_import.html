<h2>Basic workflows for importing lidar data to GRASS GIS</h2>

<p>
If you want to obtain a DEM/DSM in GRASS from .las point cloud use one of the following options:

<ol>
    <li>binning
        <ul>
            <li>Use r.in.lidar to create raster map using binning. Crude but fast.
            <li>Multiple tiles can be merged by r.patch after r.in.lidar (since they are raster maps)
        </ul>
    <li>interpolating
        <ul>
            <li>Use v.in.lidar to create vector map with points
                (you can use -t and -b to not build topology and attribute table and speed up the process)
            <li> Multiple tiles can be merged by v.patch (since they are vector maps).
            <li>This you can interpolate using v.surf.rst.
        </ul>
</ol>

<p>
If the projection of the .las file does not match your GRASS location use one of the following options:

<ol>
    <li>Use las2las before using r.in.lidar or v.in.lidar. The following
        example command is for reprojecting tiles in NAD83/North Carolina in feet (EPSG:2264)
        into NAD83/North Carolina in meters (EPSG:3358):
<pre><code>
las2las --a_srs=EPSG:2264 --t_srs=EPSG:3358 -i input_spf.las -o output_spm.las
</code></pre>

    <li>You can create a Location which matches the resolution of the las file and then v.in.lidar to import the points there and finally, go to the desired Location and use v.proj to re-project the data from the other Location.
   </ol>
