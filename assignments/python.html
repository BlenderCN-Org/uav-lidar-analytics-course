Tools:

<ul>
    <li>
        Your <a href="http://wingrass.fsv.cvut.cz/grass70/">GRASS GIS 7</a>
        installation should also include <a href="http://www.liblas.org/">libLAS</a> library
        which is used by GRASS modules v.in.lidar and r.in.lidar
        (standalone GRASS GIS for MS Windows, OSGeo4W and Ubuntu packages contain libLAS).
    </li>
    <li>libLAS installation should include command line tools lasinfo and las2txt.
    <!-- <li>libLAS installation should also include support for LAZ (through LAZzip library). -->
    <li>Note that for merging las tiles (not necessary for this assignment) you need LASlib's lasmerge tool (part of LAStools).
</ul>


<h3>Working with command line tools</h3>

Change coordinate system of multiple LAS files
Would also work for conversion of LAS to LAS


<h3>Import multiple files to GRASS GIS</h3>

Import LAS to GRASS GIS


<h3>Aggregating multiple maps into one</h3>

Get list names of all imported maps (available from last step as well)

Patch the maps together using v.patch

Same way we would use, e.g. r.series


<h3>Parallelization of computation on one map</h3>

Interpolate using GridModule


<h3>Working with large amount of maps</h3>

Compute difference each map with each map


<h3>Report</h3>

Compute univariate statistics for each map
Compute shaded relief for each raster map
Render each map using d.* modules
Create an HTML report from the data above


<h3>Profile</h3>

Convert vector to points for r.profile
Compute a profile for a given set of points
Draw the profile using matplotlib
