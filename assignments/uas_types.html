<h2>UAS: systems and applications</h2>

During the first lecture you’ve learned about different types of UAS
and different applications. Since it is impossible to get to know the
entire rapidly growing market of UAS, your task is to select one system and
prepare a short presentation for the class. If you have previous experience
with UAS your presentation can describe your project. This way we will be able 
to learn about a broad range of UAS and their applications.

<p>
The presentation should be 15-20 minutes long and include the following:

<ul>
    <li>Name of the UAS
    <li>Picture
    <li>Type 
    <li>Place (country) and year of manufacture
    <li>Technical specifications (size, weight, endurance, wingspan, payload….)
    <li>Main applications 
    <li>Then pick a case study that will show how the chosen UAS
        was used in industry/research/combat/private needs and
        what kind of outputs/results were obtained?
</ul>

<p>
Try to find something relevant to your research interest or just something unique that will be worth sharing.
