<h2>Basic workflows for importing lidar data to GRASS GIS</h2>
<p>If you want to obtain a DEM/DSM in GRASS from .las point cloud use one of the following options
   <ol>
	<li>Binning
		<ul>
		<li>Use r.in.lidar to create raster map using binning. Crude but fast. 
		<li>Multiple tiles can be merged by r.patch after r.in.lidar (since they are raster maps)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Interpolating
		<ul>
		<li>Use v.in.lidar to create vector map with points 
		(you can use -t and -b to not build topology and attribute table and speed up the process)
		<li> Multiple tiles can be merged by v.patch (since they are vector maps). 
		<li>This you can interpolate using v.surf.rst. </li>
		</ul>
   </ol>
</p>
<p>If the projection of the .las file does not match your GRASS location use one of the following options:
<ol>
	<li>Use las2las before using r.in.lidar or v.in.lidar 
	<br> exapmle command for reprojecting tiles in NAD83/North Carolina in feet (EPSG:2264) 
	into NAD83/North Carolina in meters (EPSG:32119)
	<pre><code>las2las --a_srs=EPSG:2264 --t_srs=EPSG:32119 -i input_spf.las -o output_spm.las</pre></code>

	<li>You can create a Location which matches the resolution of the las file and then v.in.lidar to import the points there and finally, go to the desired Location and use v.proj to re-project the data from the other Location
   </ol>
