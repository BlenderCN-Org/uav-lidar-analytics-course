<h2>Laboratory experiment: 3D reconstruction from multiple photos</h2>

Perform laboratory experiment to investigate the impact of the number and orientation
of photos, shape and features of a landscape model and light on 3D reconstruction
of a physical landscape model from multiple overlapping imagery.

<p>
We have several 3D physical models in the geoviz lab, select one and create
its 3D digital model using your camera and appropriate software.
Make sure that you do not change the zoom during the capture (unless you want to test what
impact it would have). You can also compare the models derived from a high end digital camera
and a smart phone.

<p>
Take the photos from various locations and place features on the physical model
to explore the best approach for obtaining a model with minimal distortions.
Use any suitable software for example:
<a href="http://remake.autodesk.com/try-remake">Remake</a> to create a 3D model and save
it as .obj files and .rcm models for further analysis. To create a 3D model using your phone
you can try
