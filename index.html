<h1>Spatiotemporal Analysis with UAV and LiDAR Data</h1>

<h2>Course description</h2>

The course covers monitoring, analysis, and modeling of 3D landscape change
using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and lidar data.
The principles of UAS data collection, processing of 3D point clouds and
the resulting terrain models are explained followed by
hands-on experience with multitemporal data collected by the NCSU NextGen Air
Transportation (NGAT) program. The course also covers techniques for analysis
and visualization of lidar data time series and outputs of dynamic simulations,
including immersive visualization at the Hunt library facilities.
The students will have the opportunity to work with the Tangible Landscape system
to explore impact of 3D terrain change on landscape parameters and processes.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

None but GIS/MEA582 and/or GIS540 or equivalent courses are recommended.


<h2>Educational approach</h2>

This course will consist of: lectures, readings,
hands-on exercises, homework assignments, and a major
project. All the work will be collected within an electronic
portfolio that will systematically include the work that you will do
for this and other GIS courses. Extra credits will be given for
innovative solutions, creativity in problem solving and extensions
to given tasks. Lectures on Tuesday are followed by hands-on practice on Thursday.
